# 5e-Character-sheet
This is a simple program that should be rather straightforward to use based on the prompts.

It makes use of the API at https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/ to pull relavent infromation before storing it temporarily.

Future work:
Create a gui for the program and simplify choices by using pre-filled boxes or checks.
